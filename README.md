Automatic ECG segmentation using deep learning.

### The QT Database
The [QT Database](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/qtdb/) includes ECGs which were chosen to represent a wide 
variety of QRS and ST-T morphologies, in order to challenge QT detection algorithms with real-world variability. The QT 
Database contains a total of 105 fifteen-minute excerpts of two channel ECGs, selected to avoid significant baseline 
wander or other artifacts.
